## About
This project aims to provide insights into international football team rankings by analyzing the dataset "international_matches.csv." We'll explore historical ranking data, visualize team performance, and apply machine learning to predict team ranking points.

## Dataset Explanation
The dataset "international_matches.csv" contains information about international football matches. Here's an overview of the dataset:

- **date**: The date of the match.
- **team**: The home team participating in the match.
- **rank**: The FIFA ranking of the home team.
- **rank_points**: The total FIFA ranking points of the home team.

This dataset allows us to analyze how FIFA rankings and ranking points have evolved over time for different football teams.

## Project Structure
The project's directory structure is organized as follows:

- `analysis.py`: Python script containing code for data analysis and machine learning.
- `international_matches.csv`: The dataset containing international football match information.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Data Exploration
We started by exploring the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics. Some key exploratory steps include:
- Checking basic statistics.
- Identifying missing values (if any).
- Visualizing team rankings and ranking point distributions.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involved handling any missing values and preparing the dataset for machine learning. Fortunately, there were no missing values in this dataset, so we proceeded with the analysis without the need for extensive data preprocessing.

## Visualization
Visualizations played a crucial role in gaining insights into team rankings. Key visualizations include:
- A bar chart showing the average ranking for the top 15 teams.
- A histogram of team rankings.
- A histogram of team ranking points.
- A correlation heatmap to understand relationships between variables.

## Machine Learning Models
We applied machine learning models to predict team ranking points based on available features. Three models were utilized:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees

## Results
Our models were trained and evaluated, resulting in the following accuracy scores:
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: XX%
- K-Nearest Neighbors Accuracy: XX%
- Decision Tree Accuracy: XX%

## Next Steps
Looking ahead, potential next steps include:
- Fine-tuning machine learning models for better performance.
- Exploring additional datasets to enrich the analysis.
- Deploying a predictive model for real-time ranking point estimation.
